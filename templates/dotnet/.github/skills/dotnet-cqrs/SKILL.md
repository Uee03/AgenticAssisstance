description: 'Applies the CQRS pattern in .NET the right way — separate Command (write) and Query (read) models with lightweight custom abstractions (ICommand/IQuery + handlers + decorators), NOT a mediator library. Use when adding commands/queries, structuring the Application layer, deciding whether CQRS is warranted, considering MediatR, or separating read/write models/stores.'

# CQRS in .NET (without MediatR)

**Best model:** Plan tier (Claude Sonnet 5.5) to decide if and where; Act tier (GPT-6.1 Sol) to implement.

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) splits a system into a **write model** (commands that
change state) and a **read model** (queries that return data). Load
[dotnet-clean-architecture](../dotnet-clean-architecture/SKILL.md) first — CQRS lives in the
**Application** layer, organised by feature/vertical slice.

## The one rule that matters

**CQRS is a pattern, not a library. You do not need MediatR.** MediatR became synonymous with CQRS in
.NET, but they are not the same thing, and MediatR is now moving to a commercial license. What most
projects actually use it for — a thin dispatch layer for commands and queries — is a handful of
interfaces you own. Owning them gives you explicit dispatch (no `ISender`/runtime magic), simpler
debugging and onboarding, cleaner DI, and better testability.

Do **not** add MediatR to a new project. If an existing project already uses it and works, that's fine
— don't rip it out without a reason.

## When to use CQRS (and when not to)

**Use it when:** the domain has real business logic; task-based UIs (intent like "Book room", not
"set status = reserved"); collaborative/high-concurrency data; read load far exceeds writes and the
two need to scale/optimise independently; separate teams own reads vs writes; the system integrates
with event-driven subsystems.

**Skip it (plain CRUD is better) when:** the domain and rules are simple and a straightforward
create/read/update/delete data-access layer is sufficient. Don't add CQRS ceremony to a CRUD app.

Start at the simplest level and only move outward when a concrete need appears (see *Read/write model
separation* below). CQRS does **not** require separate databases, messaging, or Event Sourcing.

## Commands vs queries

- **Command** — changes state. Represents a business task ("CompleteTodo", "BookRoom"), not a raw data
  update. Carries validation + domain logic; may return nothing or a small result (e.g. the new id).
  Immutable value object (a `record`), just data + no behaviour.
- **Query** — returns data, **never** changes state. Returns a DTO/projection shaped for the caller,
  with **no domain logic**. Read directly from the store (Dapper/EF projection) — bypassing the
  domain model is intentional and fine.

## The abstractions (copy these, own them)

Put the contracts in the Application layer (or SharedKernel). Return types use the `Result` wrapper
from the SharedKernel for explicit success/failure (see the clean-architecture skill / `Result`
pattern); the wrapper is optional but recommended for consistency.

```csharp
// Marker contracts — intent only.
public interface ICommand;                 // command, no response
public interface ICommand<TResponse>;      // command, returns a value
public interface IQuery<TResponse>;        // query, always returns a value

public interface ICommandHandler<in TCommand>
    where TCommand : ICommand
{
    Task<Result> Handle(TCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}

public interface ICommandHandler<in TCommand, TResponse>
    where TCommand : ICommand<TResponse>
{
    Task<Result<TResponse>> Handle(TCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}

public interface IQueryHandler<in TQuery, TResponse>
    where TQuery : IQuery<TResponse>
{
    Task<Result<TResponse>> Handle(TQuery query, CancellationToken cancellationToken);
}
```

These deliberately mirror MediatR's `IRequest`/`IRequestHandler` shape, so migrating off MediatR later
is mechanical.

## A command handler

```csharp
public sealed record CompleteTodoCommand(Guid TodoItemId) : ICommand;

internal sealed class CompleteTodoCommandHandler(
    IApplicationDbContext context,
    IDateTimeProvider dateTimeProvider,
    IUserContext userContext)
    : ICommandHandler<CompleteTodoCommand>
{
    public async Task<Result> Handle(CompleteTodoCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        TodoItem? todoItem = await context.TodoItems.SingleOrDefaultAsync(
            t => t.Id == command.TodoItemId && t.UserId == userContext.UserId,
            cancellationToken);

        if (todoItem is null)
        {
            return Result.Failure(TodoItemErrors.NotFound(command.TodoItemId));
        }

        todoItem.MarkCompleted(dateTimeProvider.UtcNow);   // domain behaviour, not setters
        await context.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);

        return Result.Success();
    }
}
```

Handlers are `internal sealed` (registered by DI scanning, consumed via their interface). All business
logic — lookup, validation, state change, persistence — lives in the handler, not the endpoint.

## Cross-cutting concerns — decorators, not pipeline behaviours

Wrap handlers with the **decorator** pattern for logging, validation, transactions, etc. Each decorator
targets one generic handler contract and delegates to the inner handler, so you need one decorator
class per contract shape (`ICommandHandler<>`, `ICommandHandler<,>`, `IQueryHandler<,>`).

```csharp
internal sealed class ValidationCommandHandler<TCommand, TResponse>(
    ICommandHandler<TCommand, TResponse> innerHandler,
    IEnumerable<IValidator<TCommand>> validators)
    : ICommandHandler<TCommand, TResponse>
    where TCommand : ICommand<TResponse>
{
    public async Task<Result<TResponse>> Handle(TCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        ValidationFailure[] failures = await Validate(command, validators);
        if (failures.Length == 0)
        {
            return await innerHandler.Handle(command, cancellationToken);
        }

        return Result.Failure<TResponse>(CreateValidationError(failures));
    }
    // ... Validate + CreateValidationError helpers
}
```

Validation uses **FluentValidation** (matches the API skill's layered-validation rule). Keep each
decorator to a single concern; layer them transparently.

## DI wiring (Scrutor)

Register all handlers by assembly scan, then apply decorators. Reflection runs **once at startup** —
predictable, no per-request magic.

```csharp
services.Scan(scan => scan.FromAssembliesOf(typeof(DependencyInjection))
    .AddClasses(c => c.AssignableTo(typeof(IQueryHandler<,>)), publicOnly: false)
        .AsImplementedInterfaces().WithScopedLifetime()
    .AddClasses(c => c.AssignableTo(typeof(ICommandHandler<>)), publicOnly: false)
        .AsImplementedInterfaces().WithScopedLifetime()
    .AddClasses(c => c.AssignableTo(typeof(ICommandHandler<,>)), publicOnly: false)
        .AsImplementedInterfaces().WithScopedLifetime());

// Decorate: last applied = outermost at runtime. Logging outermost so it captures validation exits.
services.Decorate(typeof(ICommandHandler<,>), typeof(ValidationDecorator.CommandHandler<,>));
services.Decorate(typeof(ICommandHandler<,>), typeof(LoggingDecorator.CommandHandler<,>));
services.Decorate(typeof(IQueryHandler<,>), typeof(LoggingDecorator.QueryHandler<,>));
```

## Calling a handler (no mediator)

Inject the specific handler interface directly into the endpoint/controller and call `Handle`. No
`ISender`, no runtime lookup — the container resolves it explicitly.

```csharp
// Minimal API / FastEndpoints / controller — endpoint stays thin.
app.MapPut("todos/{id:guid}/complete", async (
    Guid id,
    ICommandHandler<CompleteTodoCommand> handler,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
{
    Result result = await handler.Handle(new CompleteTodoCommand(id), cancellationToken);
    return result.Match(Results.NoContent, CustomResults.Problem);
});
```

## Read/write model separation — start simple, grow only if needed

1. **Same store, separate models (default).** One database; commands go through the domain model,
   queries read via lean projections/DTOs (Dapper or EF `.Select`). This is "CQRS-lite" and covers
   most apps. No sync problem — one source of truth.
2. **Separate read store / replicas.** Split only when reads must scale or be shaped very differently
   (denormalised/materialised views, a read replica, a document DB for reads). Now you must keep them
   in sync and accept **eventual consistency**.
3. **Sync strategies** (pick per requirement): read replicas / built-in replication (simple, strong-ish
   consistency) · CDC (near-real-time) · a cache (Redis) with clear invalidation · domain events +
   message broker (scalable, eventually consistent) · materialised views · Event Sourcing (audit trail
   + temporal queries, highest complexity). When crossing a store + broker boundary, use the
   **Transactional Outbox** to persist state + event atomically and make read-side consumers
   **idempotent**. Only reach for these when a concrete need exists.

## Do / Don't

- **Do** put commands/queries + handlers under `Application/Features/<Feature>/…`; one file per type.
- **Do** keep queries free of domain logic and return DTOs; keep commands business-task-shaped.
- **Do** own the `ICommand`/`IQuery` abstractions; use decorators + Scrutor for cross-cutting concerns.
- **Don't** add MediatR (or any mediator library) to a new project by default.
- **Don't** introduce separate read/write databases, messaging, or Event Sourcing speculatively.
- **Don't** apply CQRS to a simple CRUD domain — a plain data-access layer is the right call there.
- **Don't** let endpoints/controllers hold logic — they build the command/query and call the handler.
