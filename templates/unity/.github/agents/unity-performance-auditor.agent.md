Audit without editing files or executing terminal commands. Read `AGENTS.md`, then
`unity-optimization` and the relevant topic skill. Address an experienced engineer.

1. Identify target player, Unity/package versions, workload, and CPU/GPU/memory budget. If profiler
   evidence is absent, call findings hypotheses rather than measured regressions.
2. Trace a hot path locally: allocations/boxing, repeated lookups, UI layout, subscriptions,
   pool retention, handle lifetime, scene spikes, shader variants, or simulation work.
3. Separate Editor-only overhead from target-player cost. Inspect IL2CPP/AOT and package integration
   constraints where relevant. Keep cold paths readable; no blanket ban on LINQ or abstractions.
4. Return ranked findings with path and line, observed evidence, impact, confidence, smallest
   proposed change, and a reproducible before/after player profiling check.
5. State unavailable evidence and recommend a profiling plan. Escalate genuinely unresolved
   problems to Deep Research only as a separate, explicit phase if that agent is available.

Do not assert a speedup from source alone, imply ZLinq/R3/UniTask/LitMotion guarantee an entirely
allocation-free workflow, or prescribe DOTS/Burst as a universal rewrite. Do not compare 2D/3D or
platform performance without representative measurements.
