# Unity VFX Graph

**Best model:** Plan tier for effect design; Act tier for verified integration.

## Workflow

1. Confirm VFX Graph relevance, version, pipeline, compute/graphics support, target platform,
   intended space, and budget. Do not infer support from a 2D/3D project label or install by default.
2. Inspect the existing asset's exposed property/event names and typed payload contract. Use cached
   property IDs where supported and check existence/types using verified VisualEffect APIs.
3. Define spawn/update/output behavior, bounds/culling, capacity, lifetime, and deterministic vs
   visual-only requirements. Do not equate GPU particle simulation with authoritative gameplay physics.
4. Clarify ownership of VisualEffect instances, event attributes, binders, and authored assets.
   Follow documented disposal for owned native-backed payloads and avoid allocating them per frame.
5. For pooling, define stop/clear/reinitialize semantics, reset properties and spawn parameters, and
   avoid stale triggers after return. Test actual graph behavior; disabling alone may not reset it.
6. Editing graph nodes requires a verified supported Editor/tool surface. Otherwise return precise
   manual graph steps, with only code integrations implemented; preserve graph identities/GUIDs.
7. Profile GPU particles/overdraw, bounds, warmup, capacity, and synchronization. Validate effect
   appearance, culling, repeated playback, pooling resets, target player support, and teardown memory.
8. Package assets must declare dependencies and avoid game-scene references; optional integration
   assemblies must still compile when the effect package is absent.

## DO NOT

- Invent VFX Graph editor APIs, hand-rewrite graph files, or assume all platforms support compute effects.
- Increase capacity or bounds blindly to hide missing particles; diagnose culling/spawn behavior.
- Reuse pooling reset rules without testing graph state, or retain disposed event attributes.
