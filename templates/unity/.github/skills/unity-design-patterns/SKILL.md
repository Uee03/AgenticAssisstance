# Unity design patterns

**Best model:** Plan tier for selection; Act tier for approved changes.

## Workflow

1. State the current behavior, actual variation point, lifetime, and measurable pain. Check nearby
   project helpers before adding a pattern. Compare a direct implementation as the baseline.
2. Select the smallest pattern that isolates that variation; load only its reference below.
3. Define participants, ownership, invariants, and failure cases in the existing project layout.
   Keep Unity adapters separate from portable rules where useful; do not force every type abstract.
4. Implement a thin slice and test substitution, cancellation/disposal, and lifecycle boundaries.
5. Explain why the pattern earns its complexity and when the simpler baseline remains preferable.

## DO NOT

- Apply every named pattern to every feature or replace working code merely to match a diagram.
- Use a global event bus or Singleton to hide dependency and lifetime decisions.
- Mistake a generic interface for a useful abstraction or data sharing for object pooling.
- Force MVP/MVVM without considering UI Toolkit binding capabilities in the installed version.
