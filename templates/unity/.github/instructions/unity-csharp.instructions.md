# Unity C# conventions

- Support 2D, 3D, Editor tooling, and reusable UPM packages equally. Do not assume a render
  pipeline, physics dimension, scene layout, network stack, or deployment platform.
- Use the Unity project's supported C# language and API compatibility level, not the latest
  desktop .NET SDK. For packages, also respect the declared minimum Unity version.
- Preserve nearby namespaces, braces, field naming, and member ordering. Where already used,
  retain `FIELDS`, `PROPERTIES`, `UNITY METHODS`, and `DO METHODS` regions and `DoOn*` lifecycle
  helpers; do not impose them on an unrelated project or add empty regions.
- Keep MonoBehaviours and views as adapters; put testable rules in ordinary C# types. Use
  interfaces at substitution boundaries, not mechanically for every class. Inject ordinary
  C# dependencies through constructors; initialize components through an explicit composition root.
- Preserve serialized field names, types, enum values, asset GUIDs, and public package APIs.
  Use an appropriate migration when changing serialization. Never edit generated source.
- Use serializable classes for identity and mutable shared state; small structs for genuine
  value semantics. Avoid large struct copying and boxing. Inspect `[SerializeReference]` support
  before using polymorphic fields; Unity does not serialize arbitrary interfaces by default.
- Reuse existing factories, pools, observables, helpers, and Editor utilities before introducing
  alternatives. R3, ZLinq, UniTask, LitMotion, and NuGetForUnity are preferred when appropriate
  and installed, not mandatory dependencies for every feature or package.
- Verify user-added dependencies using manifests, lockfiles, NuGet configuration, asmdefs, and
  installed source. Do not install, update, or remove Unity's project-template defaults.
- Match asynchronous work, subscriptions, tweens, and pooled callbacks to their owner lifetime.
  Propagate cancellation, dispose owned subscriptions, handle exceptions, and reset pooled state.
  Do not block on `.Result`/`.Wait()`, use `async void` beyond required event boundaries, or
  start unobserved fire-and-forget work. Keep Unity object access on the main thread.
- Resolve stable references outside measured hot paths. Do not repeatedly call scene searches,
  `GetComponent`, or `Camera.main` in frame loops when caching is valid. Avoid allocating LINQ,
  captured delegates, and formatting in hot loops; measure before replacing clear cold-path code.
- Do not treat coroutines as threads, assume async APIs are allocation-free, or claim a speedup
  without a representative player-build measurement.
- Keep `UnityEditor` code in Editor-only assemblies. Implement Undo, serialized-property editing,
  and prefab override support when tools modify assets or objects. Preserve `.meta` files.
- Use verified APIs for the installed Unity and package versions. Do not invent graph-editor,
  Addressables, netcode, R3, or LitMotion calls, or hand-edit graph/scene YAML as a shortcut.
- Write comments only for non-obvious intent or constraints, in one short line. Address the user
  as an experienced software engineer; explain trade-offs rather than introductory C# concepts.
